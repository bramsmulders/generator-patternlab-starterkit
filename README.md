# generator-gruntlab - v0.6.0

> A [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator for [Pattern Lab](http://patternlab.io/), a static site generator based on Brad Frost's [Atomic Design](http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) methodologies.
> Scaffolds out a new Pattern Lab site, along with a few other optional workflow bells and whistles (Compass, Sass, Autoprefixer, Bower, Grunt) and front-end dependencies (Angular, jQuery, Modernizr, [Blocss](https://github.com/Blocss/blocss) etc.).
